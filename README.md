## Summarized Tasks

1. Create a Login screen to ask users to login using an email address or a Google account. Upon successful login, navigate the user to the Reminders screen. If there is no account, the app should navigate to a Register screen.
2. Create a Register screen to allow a user to register using an email address or a Google account.
3. Create a screen that displays the reminders retrieved from local storage. If there are no reminders, display a "No Data" indicator. If there are any errors, display an error message.
4. Create a screen that shows a map with the user's current location and asks the user to select a point of interest to create a reminder.
5. Create a screen to add a reminder when a user reaches the selected location. Each reminder should include title, description, selected location. Reminder data should be saved to local storage.
6. For each reminder, create a geofencing request in the background that fires up a notification when the user enters the geofencing area.
7. Provide testing for the ViewModels, Coroutines and LiveData objects.
8. Create a FakeDataSource to replace the Data Layer and test the app in isolation.
9. Use Espresso and Mockito to test each screen of the app:
10. Test DAO (Data Access Object) and Repository classes.
11. Add testing for the error messages.
12. Add End-To-End testing for the Fragments navigation.
